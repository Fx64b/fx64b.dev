# Video Archiver - Technical Documentation

## Overview

Video Archiver is a comprehensive YouTube video downloader and management system that provides tools to download, organize, categorize, convert, stream, and manipulate videos. Built with a microservices architecture using Next.js for the frontend and Go for the backend services.

## On Hold

This project is currently on hold due to a lack of time. I'm planning to resume development somewhere between Q3 and Q4 2025. The code is still available on GitHub, but there probably won't be any updates until then.
<br /> <br />
Once I resume development, I will update this documentation with the latest features and improvements.
<br /> <br />
In the meantime you can explore the codebase and contribute if you wish. Bellow you can see the current activity of the project.
