# Harry Potter Marauder's Map Analysis

Based on my review of your code, you have a promising start to a Marauder's Map implementation with:
- Basic map layout with rooms and corridors
- Character movement with pathfinding
- Time simulation and schedules
- Footstep visualization
- Debug mode

Let me suggest some improvements and new features to enhance this project:

## Visual Improvements

4. **Room Detail**: Add interior elements to rooms and more architectural details

## Functional Improvements

5. **Robust Pathfinding**: Fix edge cases in your current pathfinding algorithm

6. **More Characters**: Add more Hogwarts characters with unique schedules

7. **Interactive Elements**: Allow users to:
    - Click on characters to see their info/schedule
    - Toggle visibility of different character types
    - Zoom and pan the map

8. **Time Controls**: Add play/pause button and time speed controls

## Feature Additions

9. **"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good"**: Add an activation phrase input or button that reveals the map with an ink-spreading animation

10. **"Mischief Managed"**: Add a deactivation option to hide the map

11. **Secret Passages**: Add hidden corridors that appear/disappear

12. **Special Events**: Add Quidditch matches, House meetings, etc. that affect schedules

13. **Weather Effects**: Show weather conditions at Hogwarts

14. **Moving Staircases**: Implement Hogwarts' famous moving staircases

15. **Search Functionality**: Allow users to search for specific characters

Would you like me to explain any of these suggestions in more detail or help you implement a specific improvement?
